## Steps

To calculate a Jacobian matrix, follow these steps:

1. Identify the vector-valued function and its input variables.

2. Construct the matrix structure:
   - Rows correspond to the output functions
   - Columns correspond to the input variables

3. Calculate partial derivatives:
   - For each entry (i,j) in the matrix, compute the partial derivative of the i-th output function with respect to the j-th input variable.

4. Fill in the matrix with the calculated partial derivatives.

## Example

Let's calculate the Jacobian matrix for the function:

f(x,y) = (xÂ² + y, 5x + sin(y))

Step 1: We have two output functions and two input variables (x and y).

Step 2: The matrix will be 2x2.

Step 3: Calculate partial derivatives:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} &= 2x \\
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y} &= 1 \\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} &= 5 \\
\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} &= \cos(y)
\end{align*}
$$

where

$f_1(x,y) = x^2 + y$
and 
$f_2(x,y) = 5x + sin(y)$

Step 4: Fill in the matrix:

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
2x & 1 \\
5 & \cos(y)
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the Jacobian matrix for the given function.

## Key Points

- The Jacobian matrix represents the best linear approximation of a vector-valued function near a given point[3].
- For a scalar function, the Jacobian reduces to the gradient vector[3].
- The determinant of the Jacobian matrix (Jacobian determinant) is useful in coordinate transformations and multiple integrals[4].
- In higher dimensions, the process is similar but with more partial derivatives to calculate[5].

Remember, the Jacobian matrix is a powerful tool in multivariable calculus, providing crucial information about how a function behaves locally in terms of stretching, rotating, or transforming space[3].
